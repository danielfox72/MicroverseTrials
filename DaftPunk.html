<h2>1987–1992: Early career and Darlin</h2>
<div>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot secondary school in Paris. 
    The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. 
    In 1992, they formed a guitar group, Darlin', with Bangalter on bass, Homem-Christo on guitar, and guitarist and drummer Laurent Brancowitz. 
    The trio named themselves after the Beach Boys song "Darlin'", which they covered along with an original composition. 
    Both tracks were released on a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band Stereolab, who invited Darlin' to open for shows in the United Kingdom.

    Darlin' disbanded after around six months, having produced four songs and played two gigs. 
    Bangalter described the project as "pretty average". Brancowitz pursued music with another band, Phoenix. 
    Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers. 
    The name was taken from a negative review of Darlin' in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings, who dubbed their music "a daft punky thrash". 
    The band found the review amusing. Homem-Christo said, "We struggled so long to find Darlin', and happened so quickly."</div>

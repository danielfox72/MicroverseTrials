    <h1>Daft Punk</h1>

    Widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history, they achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement. 
    They garnered critical acclaim and commercial success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, indie rock and pop.</p>

<h2>1987–1992: Early career and Darlin</h2>
<div>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot secondary school in Paris. 
    The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. 
    In 1992, they formed a guitar group, Darlin', with Bangalter on bass, Homem-Christo on guitar, and guitarist and drummer Laurent Brancowitz. 
    The trio named themselves after the Beach Boys song "Darlin'", which they covered along with an original composition. 
    Both tracks were released on a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band Stereolab, who invited Darlin' to open for shows in the United Kingdom.
    <blank></blank>
    Darlin' disbanded after around six months, having produced four songs and played two gigs. 
    Bangalter described the project as "pretty average". Brancowitz pursued music with another band, Phoenix. 
    Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers. 
    The name was taken from a negative review of Darlin' in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings, who dubbed their music "a daft punky thrash". 
    The band found the review amusing. Homem-Christo said, "We struggled so long to find Darlin', and happened so quickly."</div>

<h2>1993–1996: First performances and singles</h2>
<div>In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the Scottish label Soma Quality Recordings.
The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "The New Wave", a limited release in 1994.
The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called "Alive", which was to be featured on Daft Punk's first album.

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk". It became their first commercially successful single. 
After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. The duo settled on Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype nightclubs.
They signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal to license its tracks to the major label through its production company, Daft Trax.
Bangalter said that while they received numerous offers from record labels, they wanted to wait and ensure that they did not lose creative control. 
He considered the deal with Virgin more akin to a partnership.

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes at various venues. In 1996, they made their first performance in the United States, at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin. 
In addition to live original performances, they performed in clubs using vinyl records from their collection. They were known for incorporating numerous styles of music into their DJ sets at that time.</div>

<h2>1997–1999: Homework</h2>

<div>Daft Punk released their debut album, Homework, in 1997. In February that year, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as "one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time".
According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. Critic Alex Rayner wrote that it combined established club styles and the "burgeoning eclecticism" of big beat.
In 1997, Daft Punk embarked on an international concert tour, Daftendirektour, using their home equipment for the live stage. On 25 May, they headlined the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, with Orbital and Kraftwerk.

The most successful single from Homework was "Around the World". "Da Funk" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. 
The videos were collected in 1999 as D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.

Bangalter and Homem-Christo both created record labels after the release of their debut album, releasing solo projects from themselves and their friends on Roulé and Crydamoure respectively. 
Homem-Christo released music as a member of Le Knight Club with Eric Chedeville, and Bangalter released music as a member of Together with DJ Falcon and founded the group Stardust with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond. In 1998, Stardust released their only song, the chart hit "Music Sounds Better With You".</div>


<h2>1999–2003: Discovery</h2>

<div>Daft Punk's second album, Discovery, was released in 2001. The duo said it was an attempt to reconnect with the playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. The album reached No. 2 in the UK, and its lead single, "One More Time", was a hit. 
The song is heavily autotuned and compressed. The singles "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" were also successful in the UK and on the US Dance Chart, and "Face to Face" hit number one on the US club play charts.

Discovery created a new generation of Daft Punk fans. It also saw Daft Punk debut their distinctive robot costumes; they had previously worn Halloween masks or bags for promotional appearances. Discovery was later named one of the best albums of the decade by publications including Pitchfork and Resident Advisor.
In 2020, Rolling Stone included it at number 236 in its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2021, Pitchfork cited Discovery as the centrepiece of Daft Punk's career, "an album that transcended the robots' club roots and rippled through the decades that followed".

Daft Punk partnered with the Japanese manga artist Leiji Matsumoto to create Interstella 5555, a feature-length animation set to Discovery. The first four episodes were shown on Toonami in 2001, and the finished film was released on DVD in 2003.
That December, Daft Punk released Daft Club, a compilation of Discovery remixes. In 2001, Daft Punk released a 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance as Alive 1997.</div>


<h2>2004–2007: Human After All and Alive 2007</h2>

<div>In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, the result of six weeks of writing and recording.[28] Reviews were mixed, with criticism for its repetitiveness and darker mood.[29] "Robot Rock", "Technologic", "Human After All" and "The Prime Time of Your Life" were released as singles. 
A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD, Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005, was released on 4 April 2006. Daft Punk also released a remix album, Human After All: Remixes.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered a film, Daft Punk's Electroma, at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight.[30] The film does not include Daft Punk's music. Midnight screenings of the film were held in Paris theaters starting from March 2007.

For 48 dates across 2006 and 2007, Daft Punk performed the Alive 2006/2007 world tour, performing a "megamix" of their music from a large LED-fronted pyramid. The tour was acclaimed and is credited for bringing dance music to a wider audience, especially in North America.
The Guardian journalist Gabriel Szatan likened it to how the Beatles' 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show had brought British rock and roll to the American mainstream. Daft Punk's performance in Paris was released as their second live album, Alive 2007, on 19 November 2007.
The live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" was released as a single, with a video directed by Olivier Gondry comprising audience footage of their performance in Brooklyn. In 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger".</div>
